# Abstractive Dialogue Summarization: emotions are better than a thousand words
## Deep Thought 

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on the task of abstractive dialogue summarization. Starting from the work that can be seen in link of the reasearch paper reported below, we are developing expansions such as the use of emotions associated with utterances, a procedure for injecting the best possible commonsense, and the use of a new metric, BLEURT, and a new ideal dataset for this purpose, TweetSumm.

Inside the repository, you can find Python notebooks that explain how to execute the code for both the training phase and the inference.

It is important to underline that the model needs checkpoints so that the inference can be performed. Inside the link present in the Dataset & Checkpoint section, you can find two, resulting from a training of 5 epochs on SamSum and DialogSum.
